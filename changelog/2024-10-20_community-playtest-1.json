    "<p>Welcome to the first Community Playtest!</p>",
    "<p class=\"offset\">BerryHunter will follow a \"Game-as-an-Event\" release model. That means while the server should mostly be online, support and maintenance can only be expected during communicated events like the current Playtest.</p>",
    "<p>That also means the game will change and evolve from event to event - while the state in-between is not guaranteed in any way.</p>",
    "<p class=\"help\">As you find bugs or have suggestions for the game,<br />let us know via our social media channels on the right.</p>",
    "<p class=\"offset\">Thank you very much for playing this early version of our game!</p>"
